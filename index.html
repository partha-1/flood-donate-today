                </h1>
                <p>Bangladesh is located downstream of three large river basins: the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna
                    river
                    basins. The total catchment area of these basins is 1.72 million km², with almost 93% of the
                    catchment
                    area situated outside the territories of Bangladesh – in Bhutan, China, India and Nepal. The
                    topography,
                    location and discharge from each of these three basins shape the annual hydrological cycle of the
                    country. [1]

                    Over the course of a year, Bangladesh experiences periods of extreme water availability – too much
                    and
                    too little water. Monsoon precipitation from June to September is the main source of water, and the
                    country has less water available outside of this season, termed the “dry period.” Heavy rainfall
                    during
                    the monsoon period is the main cause of flooding; this occurs almost every year, with a devastating
                    flood every 5–8 years (FFWC, 2004). Such flooding causes severe damage to agriculture and
                    infrastructure
                    and the loss of human lives.

                    Bangladesh has implemented flood control and drainage projects since the 1960s. However, structural
                    measures alone cannot totally protect the people and infrastructure from floods. Complete flood
                    control
                    in a country like Bangladesh is neither possible nor feasible. With this understanding, Bangladesh
                    started developing flood forecasting and warning systems (non-structural measures) for flood
                    management
                    (Bhuiyan, 2006). </p>
